      <p>
        You've found the official page for Team zero Gaming. We're a small eSports team made up of three primary
        members and a mix of our friends who pop in and out as we play. We started during the pandemic in 2020 when my
        son thought it would be cool to be on an eSports team but didn't think he would be good enough for it. My
        response was "Well, lets make our own then," and we did.

            <h2>zeroone4004</h2>
            <p>The epic leader of Team zero Gaming and the one who started it all. Usually pretty chill but expect
              some raging if z2 talks him into doing a death run in Fortnite.</p>
            <p>Favorite Games: Astroneer, Factorio, Destiny 2, Fortnite \(if z2 is playing\), pretty much every Zelda
              game, and many more</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Zeroone4004, also known as "zero," was the first member of Team zero Gaming. The other two are zero's kids
          who thought zero's gamertag was awesome and decided to be zerotwo4004 and zerothree4004. Zero plays the
          widest variety of games including Fortnite, Factorio, Astroneer, Destiny 2, and more. He is the account
          manager for the Team zero Gaming twitch stream, YouTube channel, and Facebook page.

          Zerotwo4004 was the second member to join Team zero Gaming. Usually you can find us playing with two or
          three other people who are usually friends of z2. Z2 usually plays Fortnite but also plays Minecraft
          frequently. He sometimes talks zero into playing Minecraft with him too.

            <p>Son of the original zero. Ofter recruits his friends to play with Team zero. Likes to laugh and have a

            <h2>zerothree4004</h2>
            <p>The youngest member of Team zero. Decided to follow her brother z2 in the zero naming scheme when
              choosing her gamer tag. Usually seen sitting with zero rather than playing herself.</p>
            <p>Favorite game: Mario Kart</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Zerothree4004 is the youngest of the zeros and had been playing with them the least. Zerothree4004 is a
          brain cancer survivor and started playing with Team zero Gaming during one of her chemo treatments. She is
          in full remission now. Her game of choice is Mario Kart though she got her start playing with the team by
          playing Fortnite with zero while he was with her in the hospital.

      <h1>Rules</h1>
      <p>So I'm not a big fan of having lots of rules but over time there's a few that we have added just to make sure
        everyone can have a good time. So whenever you are playing with us please follow this list of rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>Everyone is allowed to play with us</h2>
          <p>Team zero Gaming was born out of others excluding younger players from joining an eSports team. We didn't
            like being left out of the fun so we won't do that to anyone else unless you give us a reason to.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Respect everyone</h2>
          <p>We understand that some people are more sensitive than others and eventually even the most careful person
            says something that will offend someone. Just apologize and move on. Remember if it's not funny for all of
            us, its not funny. Yes, you'll probably hear zero rage and let our some... colorful language, but cussing
            out someone who's playing with us isn't ok.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Your loot is your loot</h2>
          <p>So every game is a little different on this but we include it for when it applies. In a game like
            Fortnite, it's all about who grabs what first. Expecting one person to be the sole owner of a loot crate
            is unrealistic because individuals who aren't part of Team zero Gaming aren't going to observe that
            either. In a game like Minecraft though, it can be really frustrating if you spend forever searching for
            loot, while someone else is just messing around or worse not even online, and you hit the jackpot with
            loot only for someone who made zero contribution to come and take it without talking to you first.
            Honestly this should all be assumed with "Respect everyone" but we've has some issues with this.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>So really to sum it all up, basically "Respect everyone" is our only rule. The other two are specific
        applications of that rule that we have encountered problems with in the past. We hope to not make this list
        longer but reserve the right to block anyone at any time for any reason though we rarely ever do. Have fun
        playing</p>
      <a class="anchor" id="games"></a>
      <h1>Games We Play</h1>
      <h2>Fortnite</h2>
      <img
        src=https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Fortnite%2Fblog%2Fseason-x-blog%2F10BR_Announce_KeyArt_BlogHeader-1920x1080-aca2c821a0e9ece24d5545ce7171d58f76598013.jpg
        alt="Fortnite" class="game-art" id="fortnitePic" />

      <p>Fortnite is a battle royal game. Usually you can find us playing in Duos, Squads, or Team Rumble game modes
        and occasionally on the weekends well join kfen in his custom tournaments. This is our most played game on
        stream because it's free to play so z2's friends can all play with us and it's cartoon like style makes it a
        bit more friendly for the younger players who play with us.</p>
      <span class="section-break"></span>
      <h2>Minecraft</h2>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/51/Minecraft_cover.png" class="game-art" alt="Minecraft"
        id="minecraftPic" />
      <p>Minecraft is one of z2's favorite games. Minecraft has a lot of gathering resources and building things.
        While not a free game this one is pretty common with younger players so again we can play it with z2's
        friends
      </p>
      <span class="section-break"></span>
      <h2>Destiny 2</h2>
      <img src="https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/ttv-boxart/Destiny%202-285x380.jpg" alt="Destiny 2" class="game-art"
        id="destiny2Pic" />
      <p>Destiny 2 is a first person shooter MMO. Destiny isn't as kiddy as some of the other games we play but the
        goal of Team zero Gaming is allowing anyone to play with us not being a kids team. This is zero's game of
        choice though you won't often find him in the PVP matches. He prefers the PVE events and story levels.</p>
      <span class="section-break"></span>
      <h2>More...</h2>
      <p>This is just a short list of some of the games we play. As we continue to grow and evolve we will for sure
        add to our games too.</p>
